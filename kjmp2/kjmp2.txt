kjmp2 - a minimal MPEG-1/2 Audio Layer II decoder
version 1.1

kjmp2 is a small library that decodes "MP2" audio data.
Please read again: It decodes MPEG Audio Layer II (!) ONLY!
***** It won't play Layer III ("MP3") audio! *****

For your listening pleasure, some tiny player applications for Win32/x86 and
Linux/x86 are supplied as well. The Win32 version is only 3.63 KiB!

kjmp2 is:
 - easy to use: the API consists of only 3 functions
 - small: only 432 lines of C code (excluding comments, but including tables)
 - lightweight: compiles to ~2 KiB of x86 code plus 2.4 KiB data and requires
   20 KiB of memory at run time
 - portable: no hardware- or architecture-specific code is used (except for the
   player applications)
 - open source: the decoder library is licensed under the zlib license, the
   player applications are public domain
 - (somewhat) understandable: the code is nicely commented
 - a "clean room" implementation, using only the specifications (ISO 11172-3
   and ISO 13818-3), no code was copied from other implementations
 - integer-only: no floating point math is used, only fixed point computations
   on 32-bit integers are done
 - imprecise: due to the integer-only implementation, many rounding errors will
   occur; expect a 45-55 dB noise margin!
 - slow: it implements the synthesis process from the spec, which is very slow
   (82 multiplications, 1-2 divisions and countless shifts and additions per
   sample!)
 - not robust: it may easily crash on broken input data. Also, it ignores CRC
   values completely.
 - not thread-safe
 - a quick hack made in only 14 hours of work (plus 5 hours for the player
   applications, plus 2 hours debugging and testing of corner cases, plus 2
   hours for MPEG-2 low sample rate support)
